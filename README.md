**Welcome to SwapX — The Omni-chain DEX Hub**

SwapX is a decentralized token exchange system built on the powerful **Uniswap v2/v3** protocols. By deeply integrating the industry-leading **Li.Fi** aggregation protocol, SwapX has evolved from a single-chain DEX into an omni-chain liquidity hub. We aim to provide users with a one-stop digital asset management solution featuring cross-chain, cross-protocol, and fiat-to-crypto capabilities.

As the core engine of the **Xone Ecosystem**, SwapX not only supports lightning-fast on-chain swaps but also breaks down barriers between blockchains to create a truly seamless cryptocurrency trading environment.
