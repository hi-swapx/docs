# 🤝 LIFI aggregation access

## 1. 📖 Overview

[SwapX](https://swapx.exchange/) integrates the **[LiFi](https://li.fi/)** aggregated liquidity platform to provide a superior trading experience.

By leveraging Li.Fi’s robust cross-chain infrastructure, [SwapX](https://swapx.exchange/) breaks down the traditional "silo effect" between blockchains, achieving **full-chain interoperability**. Users no longer need to switch between different bridges and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Within the single [SwapX](https://swapx.exchange/) interface, you can complete seamless transfers and swaps of multi-chain assets.

Whether it is a **same-chain token swap** or a **cross-chain asset migration** (e.g., from Xone Chain to BSC, or BSC to Ethereum), it can be completed with just one click.

## 2. Key Features ✨

### 2.1 Aggregated Liquidity & Multi-Chain Support
* **Technical Foundation:** Powered by the Li.Fi protocol, [SwapX](https://swapx.exchange/) aggregates liquidity from major cross-chain bridges and DEXs to find the optimal swap path and exchange rate for users.
* **Extensive Ecosystem:** Supports asset interoperability across a vast range of mainstream and emerging public chains.

| Category | Supported Chains |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Layer 1** | Ethereum, BSC, Avalanche, Polygon, TRON  |
| **Layer 2** | Xone, Arbitrum One, OP Mainnet, Base|


> **Use Case:** Users can easily swap USDT on the **XONE Chain** for USDT on **BSC**, or bridge USDT from **BSC** to **Ethereum**.

### 2.2 Seamless Cross-Chain Swaps
* **Atomic Transactions:** Combines "Asset Bridging" and "Token Swapping" into a single step. Set your source and destination; the system automatically handles bridging and swapping in the background.
* **Flexible Recipient Addresses:** Supports specifying a destination address during the transaction. You can swap to your current wallet or send directly to a different address.

### Step 3: Confirm Recipient Information 👤
* **Recipient Address:** A field is provided at the bottom of the interface.
* **Self-Swap:** Ensure the address matches your currently connected wallet.
* **External Transfer:** If sending to another person or an exchange, paste the destination wallet address into the **"Enter Address"** field.
* *Example:* When swapping 100 USDT (BSC) to Ethereum, the UI clearly displays the estimated 99.44 USDT arrival after accounting for cross-chain slippage/fees.
