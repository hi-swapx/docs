# SwapX V3 SDK

JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for SwapX V3 with concentrated liquidity support.

## Contents

- [📚 Guides](./guides/README.md) - SDK usage guides
- [📖 Reference](./reference/README.md) - API reference

The SwapX v3 SDK provides abstractions to assist you with interacting with the SwapX v3 smart contracts in a Typescript/Javascript environment (e.g. websites, node scripts). It makes uses of the **Core SDK** to gain access to abstractions that are common amongst the SwapX SDKs. With the SDK, you can manipulate data that has been queried from the [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) using libraries that assist with needs such as data modeling, protection from rounding errors, and compile time enforced typing.

To begin, we recommend looking at our **Guides** which include runnable examples and walkthroughs of core usages. These guides will help you better understand how to use the SDK and integrate it into your application.

For complete documentation of the SDK's offerings, see the **Technical Reference**.

## Installation
