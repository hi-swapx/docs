## The SwapX Core SDK

The SwapX Core SDK provides abstractions for other SDKs to use in a Typescript/Javascript environment. It is used throughout the SwapX SDKs, such as the v3 SDK.

This SDK is not expected to be used in isolation, but only as part of other SDKs.

We recommend taking a look at the [**Technical Reference**](./reference/overview).
